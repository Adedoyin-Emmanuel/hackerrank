# HackerRank Interview ðŸš€

This repo contains the **HackerRank 1 Week Interview Coding Challenges**. If you're wondering why all my files are **.ts**, the reason is because I use **Bun** and by default, bun can run **Ts** files without the need to compile to **JavaScript**. You ca use [Bun](https://bun.sh) to run your **TypeScript** files automatically.
